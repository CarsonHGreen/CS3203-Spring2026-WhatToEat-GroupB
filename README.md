# WhatToEat
WhatToEat is the all-in-one food managing program. At its core, WhatToEat is meant to help anyone seeking to figure out home cooking, no matter if their just learning to live on their own or if their fully-settled and kitchen-experienced.

It does this by giving users recipes they can cook based on the ingredients they currently have. WhatToEat is planned to also have meal planning capabilities, an AI-driven recommendation system, and nutrition tracker, all working to make figuring out what to eat easy.

It is important to note that this README mirrors the progress of [project name], so anything that is currently a placeholder will be changed when appropriate.

## Installation
While there is currently no way to install WhatToEat in a working manner, it is planned to be a fully-functional web-app
## Usage
When finished, WhatToEat will be web-based, public to all, at a domain which will be determined when it is ready to publish. However, as there is also currently no runnable version, usage is minimal
## Current Status
WhatToEat is still in the early programming phase, so there exists no working product right now. But there are four sprints worth of content planned out for our future development which can be seen in the [Roadmap](#roadmap)
## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Core Project
- **Ingredient Tracker**
	- Keeps track of the ingredients the user current has 
	- Stores the expiration date of each ingredient

	- Scrape and store recipe data from popular recipe sites
	- Based on the ingredients the user has, find recipes they are able to cook
### Phase 2: Additional Core Features
- **Standardized UI**
	- Create a standard UI to give [project name] a clean and professional style
- **Accounts**
	- Accounts help store ingredient information and past recipes per user. Also can be used for future informational storage
- **Recommendation AI**
	- Use modern LLMs to recommend users recipes they may enjoy based on their previous recipes and available ingredients
### Phase 3: Meal Planning
- **Meal Planning**
	- Allow the user to create a plan for what they will eat in the near future and recommend recipes for this plan
- **Shopping List**
	- A shopping list based on the meal plan so the user has an easier time cooking recipes they are interested in
### Phase 4: Extra Features
- **Nutrition Tracker**
	- Tracks the macro information of the recipes they cook
